Description: Write sequential-looking code that pauses and resumes.
             gen() creates a generator, an iterator that returns a
             value and pauses each time it reaches a yield() call.
             async() creates a promise, which runs until it reaches
             a call to await(), then resumes when information is available.
             These work similarly to generator and async constructs
             from 'Python' or 'JavaScript'. Objects produced are
             compatible with the 'iterators' and 'promises' packages.
